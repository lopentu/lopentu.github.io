Their strong performance on NLP benchmarks, together with their striking naturalness in conversation, contributed to stimulate a new debate in public discourse and media about the imminent arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It has been shown that LLMs can display new abilities and generalizations that were not predictable simply on the basis of parameter scaling-up (i.e. emergent abilities), which also prompted the question on whether such systems can generate novel concepts and ideas beyond what they have seen during their training – or, in other words, whether they can be creative. Although machines may not be creative in the same way as humans are, the fact that AI-generated texts and images are becoming more and more undistinguishable from human creations raised a lot of debate and the understandable fear that, consequently to the application of the new technology in fields such as journalism, literature and visual arts, many jobs are going to disappear. In my talk, I will try to address some of the following questions: What are the applications of LLMs to the humanities, and what is next for our disciplines? What do we mean when we talk about “machine creativity”? Are human creatives going to be replaced, or is a human-AI cooperation the most likely future?</p>"},{date:"2023-12-26",tag:"活動",status:"Upcoming",title:"本實驗室將邀請曾昱翔博士後研究員蒞臨演講",content:"<p>講者:Yu-Hsiang Tseng | 曾昱翔 Post-doc researcher, Universität Tübingen </p><p>時間:2023年12月26日（三）16:00~17:00</p><p>地點:樂學館304室</p> <p>講題 :Decoding linguistic representations from large language models: case studies of text and speech embeddings</p> 摘要 :Large language models, such as GPTs, learn to generate human-interpretable content through exposure to a large amount of linguistic inputs. The practical success of such models is unequivocal, positioning them as the best natural language processing implementations at scale. From another perspective, these models are also the computational instantiation of a linguistic-form process theory, although the theory remains underspecified. By reverse-engineering the models, we may glean insights into their processing mechanism and reveal the possible underlying properties of our language. In this talk, I discuss two case studies of studying the model with their representations. The first examines the Chinese diachronic semantic change modeled by fined-tuning a language model with historical texts across different dynasties. The analyses of the model's hidden representations reveal the usage shifts of the same word types over time. The second study looks into the multilingual text and speech translation model representations, revealing the token-level correlations between the speech and text embeddings of identical word types. Both studies demonstrate the possible use of studying language with the help of large language models."},{date:"2023-12-18",tag:" 活動",status:"Completed",title:"本實驗室將邀請 UCLA 陶紅印老師來訪本實驗室",content:"<p>12月18日(一)下午4:30 ，地點：樂學館305室</p> <p>UCLA的陶老師將來參訪本實驗室的多模態語料庫，觀迎有興趣多模態言談分析的同學一起參加。</p>"},{date:"2023-12-08",tag:"活動",status:"Completed",title:"本實驗室邀請牛津大學研究團隊參與學術交流活動",content:"<p>12/8(五)下午 2:30 ，地點：樂學館304室</p> <p>地點:陽明交通大學浩然圖書館B1國際會議廳</p> <p>本實驗室非常榮幸邀請牛津大學國際多模態溝通研究中心（International Multimodal Communication Centre）的主持人Anna Wilson博士，以及三位資深協同研究員，來訪本實驗室，參觀謝舒凱教授所領導的研究計畫。</p>"},{date:"2023-12-13",tag:"活動",status:"In Progress",title:"謝舒凱教授在陽明交通大學演講",content:"<p>講題:語言與科技相遇的地方</p><p>地點:陽明交通大學浩然圖書館B1國際會議廳</p><p>時間:2023/12/13 (三) 13:20~15:10</p>"}];export{e as default};
