Their strong performance on NLP benchmarks, together with their striking naturalness in conversation, contributed to stimulate a new debate in public discourse and media about the imminent arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It has been shown that LLMs can display new abilities and generalizations that were not predictable simply on the basis of parameter scaling-up (i.e. emergent abilities), which also prompted the question on whether such systems can generate novel concepts and ideas beyond what they have seen during their training – or, in other words, whether they can be creative. Although machines may not be creative in the same way as humans are, the fact that AI-generated texts and images are becoming more and more undistinguishable from human creations raised a lot of debate and the understandable fear that, consequently to the application of the new technology in fields such as journalism, literature and visual arts, many jobs are going to disappear. In my talk, I will try to address some of the following questions: What are the applications of LLMs to the humanities, and what is next for our disciplines? What do we mean when we talk about “machine creativity”? Are human creatives going to be replaced, or is a human-AI cooperation the most likely future?</p>"}];export{e as default};
